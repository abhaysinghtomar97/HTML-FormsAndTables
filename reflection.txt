Approach: Structured the form and table using semantic
          HTML and styled with CSS for user-friendly design.
          Faced alignment challenges, resolved by tweaking margins and padding.

Learning: Learned the importance of "border-collapse: collapse" 
          for tables and "display: block" for proper label alignment. 
          Gained better understanding of structuring forms and debugging CSS issues.
